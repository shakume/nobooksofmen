<h2>Angels/Demons</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Angels & Demons <i>do not exist</i> in the No Books setting</li>
	<li>While there are a number of creatures which resemble the classic idea of an Angel or Demon they are not.
	<ul>
		<li>Some are actually just non-sentient creatures resembling the concept sufficiently to "convince" viewers of their categorization as "Angel" or "Demon"</li>
	<li>Some are spirits "created" by belief and conception, but are more reflections of an expectation than proof of either creature's "true" existence.</li>
	<li>Some stories of both/either are actually misunderstood encounters with Heralds or their ilk.</li>
	<li>Many in-universe believe in one, the other, or both. In these case they either see one or more of the above examples as "proof" and deny evidence to the contrary; or they see such beliefs as a matter of faith and cast aside doubt.</li>
	<li><i>Note: This does not "disprove" the existence of any higher power in the setting. Indeed, the existence of "higher powers" is undeniable. The question is the level of authenticity of any/all religions in the setting, versus misunderstandings of those entities confirmed to exist.</i></li>
	</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Catkind</h2>
<ul>
	<li>A species of sentient cat native to the Valleys. </li>
	<li>Some theorize they may have been Mages who lost the ability to change back and have established a breeding colony, thus a new subspecies. </li>
	<li>There are some reports of former huaman Mages who have become Catkind. If so, this would seem to confirm such origins. </li>
	<li>At least on Catkind continues to serve as an instructor at Columbiana University. </li>
	<li>Catkind are sentient and capable of communication, but they must rely on non-verbal forms of communication (such as writing) as their feline vocal cords cannot form human words. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Gnomes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>AKA: "Tiny Men" or Brownies</li>
	<li>A strange species of minature humans that are largely feral. Some theorize they exist in small villages in hidden places. Others believe them to be too feral for such organized societies. </li>
	<li>Generally considered "vermin" by locals. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Heralds</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Easily the least understood by the other denizens of this world.</li>
	<li>What is known to most scholars who choose to study them:
	<ul>
		<li>They are rare. Some estimate as few as half a dozen currently exist and even the most liberal estimates posit more than fifty.</li>
		<li>They serve strange masters from Realms beyond</li>
		<li>They are often tremendously powerful</li>
		<li>They are usually subtle and prefer to remain unknown actors</li>
		<li>While each is unique, there do appear to be similarities and family groups. Due to insufficient data however, these groups remain unidentified.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li> Information currently unknown, but could be discovered by the bold and interested (i.e. through development/gameplay)
	<ul>
		<li>Each serves a specific Elder Thing and manipulates events to ensure Its goals come to fruition</li>
		<li>Each ET designs its Heralds according to both Its goals and Its whims, the latter tendencies create the aformentioned "families"</li>
		<li>While Herald numbers are low in this Realm, their numbers are much higher if counted across ALL Realms</li>
		<li>There are actually closer to two dozen Heralds active on (this) Earth at any given time, but they serve (currently) four different masters and are at cross-purposes</li>
		<li>For every conflict between a Herald and another supernatural group, there are dozens of inter-Herald conflicts which break out.</li>
		<li>There is a small (less than half a dozen) faction of Rogues, Heralds which have turned against their former masters for one reason or another. There is very little communication between these Rogues, but they are very protective of their own</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>There are many aspects and details of Heralds, their masters, and their missions which are unlikely to be known in-universe. Even Rogues will not be overly forthcoming, due to fear of discovery or unintentionally aiding their enemies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Robot</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Sentient machines capable of independent mobility.</li>
	<li>Widely varied in shape, size, and anatomy.</li>
	<li>No two are exactly alike.</li>
	<li>Officially documented as always of human/mage origin, though a few point to Wyrdling automata being possible.</li>
	<li>Rumours persist of a robotic society hidden in the Woods and that some have become capable of independent reproduction, but these rumours remain unsubstantiated.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sasquatch</h2>
<ul>
	<li>AKA: Bigfoot, Skunkape, Yeti</li>
	<li>A widespread but rare species of humanoid ape.</li>
	<li>Of equal intelligence to human beings, but incapable of human speech and with wildly different culture.</li>
	<li>Common but well hidden in Western North America.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sea Serpent</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Rare in freshwater sources, but rumoured to be common in ocean climates.</li>
	<li>Most are serpentine and can grow up to hundreds of yards in ideal conditions.</li>
	<li>Reasonably intelligent, slightly moreso than a Gorilla.</li>
	<li>Highly predatory in most cases.</li>
	<li>Only one known in North America, living in Deep Lake of Columbiana Valley.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Shadow Creatures</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Creatures of darkness, cold, and destruction.</li>
	<li>Believed to be spirits that have somehow managed to traverse to the Physical Realm and manifest physically.</li>
	<li>Once thought rare, but have appeared in massive numbers in Ambrosiana Valley.</li>
	<li>Massive Infestation of Ambrosiana Valley, rarely spotted in Columbiana Valley at night.</li>
	<li><b><i>Please Advise: Avoid traveling outside of town after dark and avoid Ambrosiana Valley at all costs!</b></i> </li>
</ul>

<h2>Skeletons</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Reanimated remains of human beings.</li>
	<li>Extremely rare to exist without the active intent of a Mage or similar magical source.</li>
	<li>A known infestation exists of malevolent and violent Skeletons exist in Columbiana Valley, but only the energies of Samhain allow them to manifest in any significant number.</li>
	<li>The influx of such creatures and the threat they present have resulted in a yearly ritual that locals refer to as the "Skeleton War."</li>
	<li>Clearly created from human remains, but in large manifestations their numbers seem to be independent to reasonable amounts of human remains for the numbers produced.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Spirits</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Spirits exist in a strange state. They are both separate from, yet essentially tied, to the physical world. They represent concepts, or the essential nature of creatures, or the remains of something which once existed in the physical world. </li>
	<li>If a spirit is (permanently) destroyed, its essence and its place in the world is harmed. Conversely, if the physical "source" of a spirit is wiped away, the spirit is fundamentally weakened.</li>
	<li> All sprits exist in a realm/state referred to as the "Spirit Realms." There are two layers to the Spirit Realms
	<ul>
		<li>The Echo: This is the place where most spirits characters might meet reside. It is a "halfway" point between the physical/"real" world and the deeper Spirit Realms. The spirits and objects of The Echo are superimposed over the physical world in a way not unlike AR-programs appear. Some estimates place as many as 90% of all spirits spend at least part of their time in the Echo.</li>
		<li>The Realms: "Deeper" than The Echo, The Realms are the bizarre landscapes that are wholly abstract and representative. Though it is theorized there are as many Realms as there are sentient minds in all of history, most are tied to three main realms.
		<ul>
			<li>The Astral Reaches: Places of the mind and conception. The most abstract of the Realms. This is a place of Collective Unconscious, the remnants of the Library at Alexandria, and the World Soul.</li>
			<li>The Wilds: Places of primordial and untouched wilds. In most places, it resembles real-life locations but as they would be if humanity had never existed. Other Wild Realms may reflect ancient periods of history, places reflecting possible histories and pasts where other beasts take mankind's place at the top, and it is theorized that even mythical Eden may still exist somewhere in the Wilds.</li>
			<li>The Shadowlands: Realms of the dead and gone. Echoes and remnants of things which once thrived in the physical world, but now nothing remains. Cities cramped with demolished buildings, wild places filed with extinct plants and animals (differing from the Wilds as there is no hope of survival but rather the echoes of their tragic passing), and the Void which destroys all things in a vortex of pure Entropy.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>The Truth: In reality, though nothing living or existing in the current universe knows, is that The Echo and the Realms and everything else in the Spirit Realms are the same place. In turn, the Truth and the Place (i.e. the "physical realm") are two sides of the same coin.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Note: All Ghosts are Spirits (albeit specifically of dead humans), but not all Spirits are Ghosts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Thunderbird</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Large Raptor species of bird.</li>
	<li>Distantly related to the Roc, Simurgh, and Phoenix species of other regions.</li>
	<li>Has the ability to control local weather patterns.</li>
	<li>Preserves exist along the peaks surrounding the Valleys.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unicorns</h2>
<ul>
	<li>An animal that resembles a horse with goat-like feet and a distinct horn in the middle of its forehead.</li>
	<li>Much of a Unicorn's anatomy is useful in various mystical and alchemical processes. </li>
	<li>Invasive species in Columbiana Woods, not native to North America. </li>
	<li>Often seen as a "nuisance" species. </li>
	<li>Limited intelligence. Capable of speech, but intelligence and demeanor is somewhat akin to a dolphin. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Wyvern</h2>
<ul>
	<li>A species of dragon, with simpler anatomy and some minor mammalian traits (such as a "mane"). </li>
	<li>Live in preserves along the edges along the mountain peaks at the edges of the Valleys. </li>
	<li>Intelligent and semi-sentient, with an intelligence roughly akin to that of a gorilla. </li>
</ul>
