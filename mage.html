<h2>What is a Mage?</h2>
<p>
In short: A "mage" is a person who is capable of magic, no more and no less. Some take Mages to be some sort of "homo superior" type of creature who is more evolved. Some feel that Mages are blessed by the gods, or the ancestors, or whatever. At the end of the day, Mages are people but with more power. Sometimes this manifests as Super Science and sometimes as Merlin-style spells, but regardless Mages are people who have found some way of tapping into the creative energies of creation and manipulate them for some truly impressive effects.
</p>

<h2>What are Mages "About?"</h2>
<p>
That depends on the Mage in question, which Sect they owe allegiance to, and what Society they claim membership within. All Mages by their nature seek to understand and shape the world around them, but how far and in what ways vary tremendously. Some wish to conquer/destroy/remake/whatever the world and go full supervillain or fascist. Others simply want to make the world a better place than what they found it. Some just want to not have to lean over to pick up the TV remote and so use magic to change the channel instead. The only common denominator is that they are talented in ways most "mortals" are not and can reshape reality. What they do with that power? Well, that's up to you...
</p>

<h2>How might a Mage stereotype others?</h2>
<ul>
<li><i>Shifters:</i> Filthy beasts, but intriguing. They are clearly native to this Realm, but they are wholly unnatural by the odefined order of this reality. Why do they exist and who created them? To what purpose do they "serve" their "nature?" Utterly fascinating, even if one has to deal with their strange odors. </li>
<li><i>Vampires:</i> I met a supposed vampire in the Levant once in my youth. It claimed that the ancient legends about their kind were merely myths. The sun causes discomfort but not death. That blood is "nice" but "not necessary" but what mattered was "the murder." Yet I've seen another vampire dissolve in sunlight. I cannot help but wonder if there are varying species of human form parasites. Might bear further study, especially if they prove to be extraplanarly originated...</li>
<li><i>Wyrdlings:</i> Speaking of the extraplanar. These unfortunates are what happens when a mortal is exposed to the power of an Elder Thing. Like mutations in a mid-century science fiction film, the emanations of the otherworldly energies have warped them into something utterly inhuman. Strange though that they tend to mutate into creatures identifiable as mythological creatures from mortal folklore, even if such creatures actually exist and take wholly different forms than what the Wyrdling takes. Regardless, they are unfortunate victims, not threats themselves. They should be pitied, not feared. Nonetheless, we must remain vigilant that their mutations do not spread...</li>
<li><i>Ghosts:</i> Sometimes a mortal dies with unfinished business and the willpower to persist without a body. It is rare. Rarer still is the spirit which retains its personality. Nonetheless they prove an interesting diversion. Some seek assistance resolving their issues so they may pass onto another life. Some are simply content to exist without death.</li>
<li><i>Mortals:</i> Unlike our... <i>"cousins"</i> among the "Exalted Order" we do not believe that mortals are any less valid or important than the life of a Mage. Some even argue that every mortal bears the potential to awaken to the power of magic. This remains unproven. Regardless, most of humanity does not believe or approve of our use of magic so we must remain discrete when around the "mundanes."</li>
<li><i>Legendaries:</i> The modern world is not altogether kind to any species of animal, but doubly so the animals with magic intrinsic to their natures. Just think of the Dodo. Then imagine if the Dodo had the ability to levitate objects with its mind. You begin to see the problem. Thus many of our kind have established natural preserves for various mystical species within our Domains, so that even if the outside world is hostile to such creatures that they will not fade from our world.</li>
</ul>
