<h2>A Note on Power</h2>
<p>
Our magic system has gone through a number of forms over the years, but for ease of use we're just going to use the Mage: the Awakening Arcanum as a basis. We do not however require "levels" in the respective Arcanum. If you take "Space" you can realistically use any and all powers within that Arcanum but the higher the level the harder you are (especially if still a student). 

To represent different levels of "training" the different "ranks" will not determine how many points you have in each power, but rather how many Arcanum you have.
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Students:</i> Two Arcanum of your choice.</li>
<li><i>Graduates:</i> Three Arcanum of your choice.</li>
<li><i>Professors:</i> Four Arcanum of your choice.</li>
<li><i>Masters:</i> Five Arcanum of your choice.</li>

<p>
More information can be found <a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Arcanum_(MTAw)">here.</a>
</p>

<h2>Death</h2>
<p>
The Arcanum of Death deals, as the name implies, with the powers of death and undeath. A mage skilled in this Arcanum can steal and trap souls, speak with the dead, steal years from a target, raise zombies, and, with sufficient skill, even bring the dead back to life. 
</p>

<p>
Death allows control and command of ghosts in much the same way that Spirit affects spirits. Mages draw a heavy distinction between the two, however: according to Atlantean lore, spirits are the native form of life in the Shadow, while ghosts are not proper beings at all. They are merely echoes, memories of a soul's passage left in the ephemera which only mimic consciousness, and as such few mages have qualms about using them for their own ends. 
</p>

<h2>Fate</h2>
<p>
Fates purview covers all aspects of destiny and probability, though it cannot predict the future; that is the purview of Time. Common uses for Fate are creating good or ill fortune, bestowing blessings and curses, mystically sealing an oath, or predicting or influencing random events. This last effect is not always clear; mages often differ over whether using Fate to predict a coin toss, for example, informs of the outcome or creates it. The Arcanum of Fate grants perception and control over the threads of fate. It deals with the bestowing of blessings or curses, the swearing of inviolable oaths, and the ability to perceive the destinies of others (though not their future). A mage learned in the ways of this Arcanum can level a geas on another, forcing this person to do the mage’s whim. They may increase their luck or that of another to incredible levels, or decrease the fortune of a foe. The control over the strands of fate granted by this Arcanum makes it quite attractive to the Acanthus; they are deeply reliant on fortune in their itinerant lifestyles. 
</p>

<h2>Forces</h2>
<p>
Forces controls all forms of energy and force, natural or artificial, found in the material world, including heat, light, electricity, radiation, gravity and kinetic energy. It cannot affect raw magic or the mystical energies of other supernatural forces - that requires Prime - but is nevertheless a very powerful Arcanum, allowing mages to throw fireballs or call down lightning. The Arcanum of Forces deals with the creation and manipulation of the Fallen World’s various natural energies. A mage knowledgeable in this Arcanum can fly, become invisible, hurl lightning, or cause earthquakes
</p>

<h2>Life</h2>
<p>
Life allows a mage to influence the various life forms of the World. Any terrestrial organism may be affected by the spells of this Arcanum, and their effects range from the healing of wounds and transformation into other creatures to the spreading of disease and sapping of physical strength. The mage can change her shape, make her body stronger, alter her physical appearance, control the behaviour of life forms all the way up to humanity, and raise life from one state to another. 
</p>

<p>
Mages learning the lore of Life begin with control over only the simplest organisms; as they grow in knowledge, they may affect more complex lifeforms. For these purposes, all living things are designated as Base (plants, fungi, microbes and insects), Median (other non-sentient animals) or High Life (humans and other thinking animals). The Undead - even thinking, previously living humans like vampires and revenants - cannot be affected by Life magic; they fall under the purview of Death.
</p>

<h2>Matter</h2>
<p>
Matter is used to manipulate all forms of unliving matter, including organic substances which are not themselves alive, like orange juice or milk. It encompasses the classical elements, alchemical arts like transmutation, and the workings of non-magical tools and weapons. As a mage gains greater mastery in Matter they learn to affect more complex materials. This is a more metaphysical distinction than a scientific one; it requires lesser mastery to transmute liquids than gases, for example, and mud is easier to affect than precious metal. Matter cannot be used to enchant devices - that requires Prime - but at high levels it can affect or destroy extraordinary substances. A Master of Matter can combine the Arcanum with Prime to create a unique magical substance known as Thaumium. This material is expensive to create, as it is a magically fortified alloy of perfected gold, silver and mercury, but it is prized by mages because items made from it can deflect Awakened magic. 
</p>

<h2>Mind</h2>
<p>
Through the Universal Unconscious, this Arcanum connects with the minds of all thinking beings, including humans, animals, spirits and even ghosts or other supernatural creatures. Though the power of an Awakened knowledgeable in Mind holds no sway over the physical nature of the world, a skilled mage still has much use for the manipulation of the Universal Consciousness (what mental health professionals theorize about the minds of others Mind Mages know), telepathy, mind wiping, thought control, using people like puppets; are just some of the powers available to a mage proficient in the Mind Arcanum. Mind Mages can raise the power of theirs or someone else’s mind, create hallucinations, trick people into thinking that they, another person, or even the original target is another person or thing, or simply batter at an enemy’s body with sheer force of will. The Mind Arcanum wields even more power when put to work in Astral Space, a dimension formed entirely from the dreaming and thinking minds of humans, entities and other creatures of the Fallen and Shadow Realms. It can be used here to enter the various realms of Astral Space, penetrate the Oneiros and another, stabilize dream spaces or objects, jump directly between Oneiroi, or even imprison others within the treacherous confines of the human subconscious. On lesser, more worldly scales, the Arcanum is very useful in day-to-day life. A mage can read thoughts, detect emotions, and implant suggestions in the minds of others.</p>

<p><i>Special Note: Mind Powers can get very god-moddy. Please do not use Mind Magic on other PCs without player consent!</i></p>

<h2>Prime</h2>
<p>
Prime may be best described as the magic of magic; it controls the basic energy or "particle" of magic, the prima materia that mages usually experience as Mana or Tass. Knowledge of Prime allows mages to manipulate this energy, allowing a mage to alter the spells of others, imbue mundane objects with magical properties, and manipulate resonance and auras. The Arcanum of Prime deals with magic in its raw and unrefined state, wielding the Primordial Fire directly in the World, rather than merely altering its facets. A mage skilled in Prime can form perfected images, dispel the works of other mages, shield herself from magical power, tap the power of tass, read the nature of a being through its aura, and hurl bolts of divine fire, the most powerful offensive weapon in Awakened society, according to its wielders. So far, nothing has been found to dispute their claims. 
</p>

<h2>Space</h2>
<p>
Space commands both physical and metaphysical space, useful not only for travel and viewing distant events, but for erecting wards and determining the connections between things. Common applications of the Space Arcanum include teleportation, scrying, improving spatial awareness and manipulating the sympathetic connections between objects and/or people. Space governs the manipulation of distance, dimension, and scale. The powers granted by the Arcanum allow a mage skilled in its use to perform a wide range of abilities. Such a mage can instantaneously travel from one place to another with the use of portals and teleportation. One may view far-off locales by means of scrying, or create barriers to block scrying and any other remote senses or prevent teleportation into their demesne, or perform any number of other effects.
</p>

<h2>Spirit</h2>
<p>
Spirit magic can affect all aspects of the Shadow Realm; with it, a mage may perceive twilight spirits, command them to do her bidding, cross the Gauntlet between worlds and, like the Death Arcanum, affect the human soul. The Arcanum of Spirit governs interaction between the material and spiritual realms of the Fallen World. It deals with communion with spirits, manipulation of Essence, and control over the Shadow Realm. A mage skilled in the use of this Arcanum can see across the Gauntlet, summon spirits into objects, creatures, or directly into the material realm, enter the Shadow Realm, and even create his own spirit court.</p>

<p>Spirit magic cannot affect ghosts, and Death cannot affect spirits; they are different classes of being, despite both being made of ephemera. Indeed, spirits cannot usually be affected by any spell that does not make use of this Arcanum. Though both Spirit and Death may be used to affect souls, Spirit is limited to protecting or restoring them; Death grants greater control, though there are some effects it cannot duplicate. 
</p>

<h2>Time</h2>
<p>
With Time a mage may shift his perception beyond the present moment, alter the relative flow of time, and, at higher levels of mastery, move physical objects into the future or past. The Arcanum of Time governs the viewing of the interaction with the flow of time as understood within the World. Spells within the purview of this Arcanum grant the mage a wide range of abilities influencing such things as knowledge of future events and the ability to see into the past. A mage skilled in the use of this Arcanum can look back in the past or ahead into the future, alter time's flow around them or others, and, in extreme cases, travel backwards and forwards in time, or rewrite their own history. Time, not Fate, allows a mage to see the future (and the past). Such spells, however, are subject to similar rules of sympathy as those used for the Space Arcana: it is much more difficult to view times with which a mage has little connection
