<h2>The Exalted Order</h2>
<p>
A Mage society, which runs counter to the High Council. Focused more on the advancement and the empowerment of all Mages, instead of freedom of thought and independence. Though the divide with the High Council is ideological, the two groups have fought literal wars in the past.

</p>

<h2>Conspiracies</h2>
<p>
Many folks, especially Magi, are members of one Conspiracy or another because doing so is a sign of status among them. Vampires don't call their groups "Conspiracies" and prefer to call them "Cabals" instead, but the concepts are tremendously similar. Werewolves tend to gather in "Packs" which are also similar, but tend to be much larger and loosely organized. Wyrdlings have dozens of names for such groupings, but they tend to agree that "Conspiracy" works as well as any for such groups. While mixing between the various species are rare, such "cross-species" groups do exist as well.
</p>
<p>
The basic idea behind a Conspiracy is simple: A group of individuals organized towards a common purpose. This can mean as few as two individuals gathering for friendship or as many as thousands organized to manipulate global politics/media. All that identifies a Conspiracy as such is a purpose and more than one member.
</p>
<ul>
	<h3><li><i>"Circle":</i> </h3>
		<p>The smallest and most common type of Conspiracy amongts Mages is the Circle. A circle, sometimes called a Coven or other similar terms, is essentially just a group of 2-5 mages who associate and work together for various tasks. These tasks can be mundane, magical, or both. This is basically a group of friends who also happen know each other's mystic inclinations as well of social preferences.</p></li>
	<h3><li><i>The Gardeners:</i> </h3>
		<p>The Gardeners are those few magi who know of the true threat that the Elder Ones represent and they are willing to sacrifice everything to ensure these Eldritch entities remain trapped in their slumbering state. Lengthy rituals, decades of constant vigilance, and even open mockery from less believing friends and allies are the cost of ensuring that this tiny globe continues to exist for the Council and the Order to fight over.</p>
		<p>It is worth noting that The Gardeners are the only secret society who does not care about a mage's allegiance in the Schism War. While the organization is primarily populated by members of the Council, but there is a small handful of Order members and even the rare Werewolf who have joined The Gardeners' cause. Because of this, the organization strictly forbids discussing external politics during rituals and gatherings, lest political divides disrupt their essential works.</p></li>
	<h3><li><i>The A.R.E.S. Initiative:</i></h3>
		<p>Since the Schism War's beginning, there has been an endless call for mystic defenses and security to ensure the safety of the Council and its loyal members across the world. Many Council members are willing to come to the defense of their comrades, but some were more dedicated to the cause than others and focused on building an elite force of defenders. This group has gone by many names and many different organizations over the years, but in the mid-20th century it was felt that the Council's security force needed to be modernized.</p>
		<p>That is where the Analysis and Reconnaissance of Enlightened Security Initiative (or the ARES Initiative) comes in. ARES exists for the sole purpose of ensuring the safety of the world and the mages who inhabit it. There are things that go bump in the night, whose very existence is a literal and immediate danger to humanity as a whole, above and beyond the threats of the Order. A.R.E.S. was created to deal with these threats, gathering intelligence and acting against these threats before they can threaten the Council. Espionage and surveillance are their stock and trade. A.R.E.S. uses spycraft to build a better world. </p></i>
	<h3><li><i>S.E.L.F.:</i></h3>
		<p> According to SELF, the problem isn't the Exalted Order. It isn't the Kindly Ones. It isn't even the “Mortals.” It's the supernaturals themselves. They think themselves so much better than “mere mortals,” yet they hide themselves away. They tell themselves that the fight against the cold, superiority of the Exalted or the Wyld chaos of the Faerie Lords. Instead, SELF claims, everyone needs to realize that supernaturals have been nothing but a bunch of hypocrites. If “mortals” are truly capable of learning to coexist with supernaturals, as proven by the “locals,” why not now? If they can learn magic like the philosophers say, why wait? We need to stop hiding in the shadows and take things to the streets!</p></li>
