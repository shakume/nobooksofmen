<h2>What is a Shifter?</h2>
<p>
Since the dawn of time, mankind has been stalked by these beastly creatures. A simple bite makes you one of them. That small moment, when their slavering maw closes on its victims flesh curses the poor soul to a lifetime of uncontrolled transformation into a horrible monster.</p>
<p>
The werewolves themselves don't argue any of that, but they claim it wasn't always that way. They speak of a time, lost to the ages, when their kind were not considered accursed but instead as blessed. They speak of a sacred duty to protect the wild places of the world and of safeguarding this world against those that would desecrate it. They speak of noble warriors of mankind ritually binding with the souls of wolves to join the fight. They speak of a Golden Age of Mythic Wolf-Men protecting and guiding the world.</p>
<p>
Bollocks! If any of that were true, it was so long ago as to be irrelevant. If it were true, it simply preceeded a fall so epic that modern Werewolves woud be unrecognizable to those ancient paragons. Gone is the blessing, replaced with a curse which is difficult (at best!) to control. Most haven't even [i]heard[/i], let alone [i]care[/i] about any sort of "sacred duty." Worst of all, no one chooses to become a Werewolf, not any more. The bite of a Wolf-Blood, if it doesn't kill outright, warps the unwilling soul into another Wolf-Blood. The supposed "Noble Wolf-Men" have been replaced with the "Plague of Lycanthropy."</p>


<h2>What are Shifters "About?"</h2>
<p>
Werewolves are a broken and scattered people. Most believe the legends of the Golden Age are just that, legends. Even more have never heard such nonsense. The only hint of any past glory which remains is the Breeds, and believers point to the Breeds as proof of the varied Duties of the past. Skeptics dismiss the Breeds as mutations of the Curse and see proof of nothing in them. Fallen Glory or Deluded Cursed, which is right? That is for you to decide...</p>
<p>
If nothing else, the Shifters exist to protect the wild places of the world. Some follow a figure called "Gaia" with a religious fervor. Others simply can't bear to see the wonders of nature so casually destroyed. Regardless, they protect what they can, educate those they are able, and avenge that which falls despite their attempts.</p>

<h2>How might a Shifter stereotype others?</h2>
<ul>
<li><i>Mages:</i> Fucking finger wavers. *sighs* I mean, most of them seem decent enough, but if you got a hundred of them in a room you'd have 90 decent folks, 9 that are trying to either kill or rule over the 90, and one that is omnicidal enough to wipe out everyone in the room and the world outside it. Oh, and that one? Those tend to be the ones that have the power to do it. Be careful around these bastards.</li>
<li><i>Vampires:</i> Not gonna lie, I don't like 'em. They suck blood and kill things. Then again, so do some kinds of bat and mosquitos. Just cause I don't like 'em doesn't mean that I think they have no right to exist.</li>
<li><i>Wyrdlings:</i> What. The. Fuck. Are. These. Things. Some of them seem to be kind of like us. Others are something bizarre and otherworldly. Others are worse than the worst Mages for how dangerous they are. The one thing I've found is that no matter what they are, it's safe to assume the Wyrdlings are gonna confuse the shit out of you and its best to smile, nod, and get out of their way as soon as possible.</li>
<li><i>Ghosts:</i> Don't deal with them much to be honest. I know they're out there. Once in a while we run into their kind haunting some natural disaster, but its rare and each one seems as individual as the Mortals that create them. Only interesting thing I can think of is I've never once heard of a Shifter turned Ghost... Might be something to that...</li>
<li><i>Mortals:</i> They're only human. Seems simple enough. A dozen men in their prime would fall to our weakest Shifter alone. Then again. They outnumber us a few hundred million to one. This is why we're losing...</li>
<li><i>Legendaries:</i> They are of nature, even if mortals reject them. Then again, the same was true of the Dodo and the Tazmanian Wolf. Just because mortals don't believe in them doesn't mean we shouldn't protect them when we can.</li>
