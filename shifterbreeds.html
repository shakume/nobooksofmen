<p>
Werewolves are a broken and scattered people. Most believe the legends of the Golden Age are just that, legends. Even more have never heard such nonsense. The only hint of any past glory which remains is the Breeds, and believers point to the Breeds as proof of the varied Duties of the past. Skeptics dismiss the Breeds as mutations of the Curse and see proof of nothing in them. Fallen Glory or Deluded Cursed, which is right? That is for you to decide...
</p>

<h2>Balancers</h2>
<p>
The Paradoxy. The Elohith. The Even-Mooned. There are many names for this breed. Some are ancient, some are more recent. But if the legends prove true that all Shifters were once born of a particular "tribe" instead of only thier pack, then the Balancers are those who sought to bring peace and order to their scattered peoples.
</p>
<p>
The Balancers are most often tasked with maintaining peace amongst the various different species and packs of their peoples. They settle disputes and bond with the land itself to ground themselves before seeking to understand the problems that need solving for the Shifters to continue their sacred mission. 
</p>
<p>
...whatever that mission was meant to be.
</p>

<h2>Destroyers</h2>
<p>
The Erun. The Blooded. The Irakai. The Moon-Mad. No matter the name, these are those Shifters most driven by the ebb and flow of the Mother Moon Above. Thus they are a bit touched by the madness and lunacy of their patron mother and as the moon waxes and wanes, so do the passions of her children.
</p>
<p>
When the moon is hidden the sky, the Destroyers challenge anything and everything they see. If a tradition has even the slightest illogic, it must be questioned and torn apart by sharp wit and thought. When the moon waxes large, the Destroyers turn to a more literal destruction. They seek to tear down barriers and cleanse the impurities of the world like wheat before the plow.
</p>

<h2>Restorers</h2>
<p>
The Tergi. The Galled. The Bardurge. The Moon-Called. These are those Shifters called to the broken places, creatures, and souls. They seek to rebuild something that was lost, much like their patron mother who is a Moon lacking balance and fullness both. The Cresent seeks its Gibbous and vice versa, and just like the Moon itself the Shifters of this breed are ultimately incapable of feeling contentment and tranquility in a world so damaged.
</p>
<p>
Cultivators and healers both, the Restorers are driven to fix that which is broken. If a soul is touched by trauma, they will seek to treat the madness. If a land is polluted, the Restorer is driven to clean and purify it. If a body is wounded, the Restoer seeks to mend the wounds. The world can never be healed completely, but these Shifters will struggle and work until they succeed or fall in the attempt.
