<h2>All Shifter Breeds</h2>

<h3><b><i>Blessings</b></i></h3>

<h4>Heightened Senses</h4>
<p>
Even in human form, the Shifter has full access to the senses of their Beast form. This means hearing and smelling abilities much more potent than any human being is otherwise capable. The sense of smell is strong enough to track or differentiate between individuals without the need of sight. The sense of hearing is strong enough to hear things from miles away (in the wild) or many blocks away (in the city). Though these are the most common senses, feel free to mix and match based on the species of the Beast form.
</p>

<h4>Shapeshifting</h4>
<p>
All Shifters are born human, but through the Curse they are granted two other forms they may shift to at will.
	<ul>
		<li><i>Beastman:</i> Legends speak of this form once being a Shifters natural state, a fusion of man and beast with all the strengths of both sides of their nature: Power and Wisdom alike. That time, if it were ever true, is long gone. The Beastman form today is a bringer of Death. When in this form, the Shifter is immensely strong and swift (effectively doubling the already considerable physical traits of the Beast Form) but is effectively mindless. In this form, the Shifter is trapped in an endless Frenzy of instinct. Those caught in a Fighting Frenzy seek only to inflict as much damage and bloodshed possible on anything within range. Friend and Foe are meaningless in this form, only death. Those who fall to Flight Frenzy will use every tool available to them to flee and survive, regardless of the longterm cost.</li>
		<li><i>Beast:</i> The Beast Form could never be mistaken for a member of its species, as it is closer to that of an ancient Dire Beast or other Prehistoric Ancestor than its modern cousins. It's mass is almost 150% that of a modern example of thes pecies and almost every ounce of that is pure muscle. It is both larger and stockier than its modern cousin. This is the form that a Shifter typically uses to fight. </li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h4>Spirit Talk</h4>
<p>
Shifters can see through the border separating the Spirit Realms and the Physical World. Through the boundary, they can speak with the Spirits they find there and assess the spiritual health of both Worlds. Some claim that in ancient times the boundary was more permeable (or at least Shifters could cross it at will), but regardless of history the simple fact is that most Shifters cannot cross the boundary themselves. Some make friends with Mages capable of such. Others retreat to the deepest woods and the furthest reaches of deserts, searching for gaps in the Boundary in those places. Most instead choose to focus on the physical world, but use this ability to commune with local spirits to aid in their work in the physical Realm.
</p>

<h3><b><i>Curses</b></i></h3>

<h4>Moon Curse</h4>
<p>
The Shifter, regardless of origin, have been condemned the Moon herself. The very youngest amongst Shifters (i.e. the freshly turned) interpret this curse as an involuntary shift to the Beastman form under the full moon, though this is almost exclusively a sort of "self-fulfilling prophecy" as they make it happen due to the belief they have no choice. Instead, the curse takes the form of "locking" a werewolf's ability to use any trait except for Shapeshifting and Cursed Traits of their Breed under the full moon. Additionally, the Moon Curse is the source of silver's terrible power to harm a Shifter (which causes silver to ignore a Shifter's defenses and do tremendous harm besides).
</p>

<h2>Balancers</h2>

<h3><b><i>Blessings</b></i></h3>

<h4>Alignment</h4>
<p>
The Balancers can attune themselves to one of the natural elements of the world by touching an example of the element and focusing for a moment. Through this attunement the Balancer can access the following traits: Stone grants endurance, reducing damage from others by half. Flame grants power, singing the flesh of the Balancer but effectively doubling strength. Water grants adaptability, making it possible to ignore the negative effects of weather and drowning. Air grants the ability to track (via Heightened Senses) even in strong wind or other natural "masks" that make such tracking difficult.
</p>

<h4>Camouflage</h4>
<p>
 Similar to Alignment, the Balancer can instead attune themselves to the world around them as a whole. This makes them much more difficult to detect so long as they remain in the attuned environment. The exact effects of this trait varies by the terrain, but  will always optimize their stealth. Camouflage does function in the city, but is subdivided into the following "terrains": Urban, Suburban, Business. This trait does not function on clothing or other "unnatural" equipment worn by the Balancer, thus is best used either naked or in Beast form. Understandably, this can create additional complications if used in the city and crossing into a different "terrain" and thus becoming noticeable.
</p>

<h4>Entangle</h4>
<p>
By calling upon the natural world, the Balancer can "recruit" the help of the plant life to hold an individual still. This rarely manifests in an obvious fashion, meaning that vines don't leap out and constrict a target like serpents. Instead, roots and branches lift slightly to trip a target and then tighten back down to hold the wrists and ankles of the target. To the observer, this seems like bad luck but the Balancer knows better. This does function in the city, but unless there is nearby plant life it will automatically fail.
</p>

<h3><b><i>Curses</b></i></h3>

<h4>Unbalanced</h4>
<p>
Whenever a Balancer is exposed to obvious signs of Nature's imbalance (pollution, starvation, urban blight, etc) the Balancer can become obsessed with correcting the problem. The Balancer will ignore all other duties and obligations until the imbalance is corrected (or until the moon next sets). Balancers thus affected are otherwise free to act however they see fit (converse with those present, act to "fix the imbalance" however they see fit, etc), but everything not directly related to "fixing the problem" becomes secondary in the Balancer's mind.
</p>

<h2>Destroyers</h2>

<h3><b><i>Blessings</b></i></h3>

<h4>Razor Claws</h4>
<p>
Destroyers are consummate warriors and no trait signifies this more than Razor Claws. When activated (takes at least 30s of concentration) this trait sharpens the claws (or horns, or teeth, or...) on the Beast and Beastman forms of the Destroyer and causes them to tear through (mundane) armor and always leave a savage wound. Assume that any wound inflicted by Razor Claws is the worst possible form (a glancing blow opens a large wound, a chest shot tears a lung, etc). This trait can be used in human form, though in a reduced form. As human beings have nothing comparable to claws, this trait gives them mundane claws on the tips of their fingers (as a modified form of the fingernails) which can do significant damage but do not have the armor tearing or supernaturally lethal aspects when used on the lupine forms.
</p>

<h4>Shed</h4>
<p>
A warrior confined is no warrior at all. Shed allows the Destroyer to break free of his bonds. By shedding the top layers of skin and hair, the Shifter is covered in a soft and slick coating of dead skin and fur which allows him to slip out of bonds. Cuffs slide off, bars become passable (so long as the gaps are roughly large enough to conceivably fit through), ropes fall away. If any chance exists of the Shifter's escape from bondage, Shed makes it happen.
</p>

<h4>Tough Hide</h4>
<p>
Shifters are remarkably resistant to damage. Between their swiftness and generally muscular builds (and with a healthy dose of shapeshifting and berserk frenzies), there is little that can significantly harm a Shifter besides silver. Tough Hide takes this to the next level. When activated (takes about 30s of concentration) the Destroyer's skin thickens and warps to become like cured leather. Most mortal weapons glance off without harm. Even firearms and other piercing weapons only do half their normal damage. Any non-mystic and non-silver weapon becomes almost useless against a Destroyer's Thick Hide. Silver ignores Tough Hide completely.
</p>

<h3><b><i>Curses</b></i></h3>

<h4>Blood Frenzy</h4>
<p>
Activating any Breed trait (Razor Claws, Shed, Tough Hide) or Shapeshifting when in the presence of fresh blood will immediately send the Werewolf into a Fight Frenzy and will shift into the Beastman form. As a rough rule, blood is considered "fresh" if it was shed within the last half-hour and "presence" is within 10 yards. If no traits are activated, the Destroyer will still feel agitated but will maintain control of themselves. Generic traits (Heightened Senses, Spirit Talk) do not activate Blood Frenzy.
</p>


<h2>Restorers</h2>

<h3><b><i>Blessings</b></i></h3>

<h4>Healing</h4>
<p>
Shifters are born fighters. Even the Restorers have access to the Beast and Beastman forms which make them formidable forces in combat. Those who fight will, no matter their skill and expertise, get hurt sooner or later. Every living creature gets hurt sooner or later, either in fights or by nature itself. Such is the way of nature. The Restorers know this, but also know that some who woud die or be crippled by their wounds have more to do. Healing allows them to knit wounds closed, staunch even the worst bleeding, and knit broken bones. Wounds healed by this trait are immune to infection (from the wound), but this power has no other control over disease and infection and wounds already infected cannot be healed by this trait.
</p>

<h4>Pacify</h4>
<p>
Many Restorers see themselves as the opposites of the Destroyers. Where the Restorers build, the Destroyers break. Where the Destroyers break things to pieces, the Restorers create something new from the pieces. It is all part of the cycle. Sometimes the Destroyers go too far. Even the Balancers and Restorers might cause too much destruction if they lose themselves to the Beastman's rage for too long. Pacify allows the Restorers to calm that rage. Pacify will immediately cancel a werewolf's Beastman form and return her to human form. This breaks the berserk frenzy of that form and will even quell the Blood Frenzy of the Destroyers. Nothing prevents the other werewolf from immediately shifting back to Beastman and charging the Restorer, which is only complicated by Cancerous Growth which allows Pacify twice with no problem but the third will either fail or prolong the frenzy (and likely make the Restorer a target). This power <i>does</i> function on non-Werewolves, but its effects are different. It makes it very difficult to react out of anger, taking concerted effort to act aggressively, and encourages feelings of peace or camaraderie. It will not stop a Vampire from killing or a Mage defending herself, but it will encourage everyone nearby to find peaceful solutions before resorting to violence.
</p>

<h4>Regrowth</h4>
<p>
Plants wither when they are mistreated, either by humanity or by nature's fickle attentions. Especially as humanity spreads and its corrupt influence spreads through pollution and apathy. Regrowth allows the Restorer to fix some of this damage. Regrowth causes plant life to thrive regardless of condition and at a remarkable rate. Within minutes a half-dead tree blooms and produces rich and nutritious fruit. Brown and dying grass rises to waist height in an instant. Vines spread far and wide in a matter of hours. Even in dead and infertile ground (such as where a chemical spill has "salted the earth") Regrowth can cause new (but initially fragile) life to return to that barren place, but in such circumstances the remarkable feats mentioned above are impossible for many months as the new life establishes itself.
</p>

<h3><b><i>Curses</b></i></h3>

<h4>Cancerous Grwoth</h4>
<p>
Every time a Restorer uses one of their Breed traits (Healing, Pacify, Regrowth) they run the risk of wild growth and negative consequences. Every use of these traits after the third and before the next moonrise goes awry. Healing closes the wound but produces an unsightly (but otherwise benign) tumor over the closed wound. Pacify either fails outright or instead further enrages a target (and thus prolonging the frenzy). Regrowth produces twisted plants, vile and bitter fruits, and any positive traits of a plant are lost (willow bark no longer serves as a painkiller for example).
