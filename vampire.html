<h2>What is a Vampire?</h2>
<p>
Vampires. Blood-sucking creatures of the night. Everyone knows about Vampires. Everyone knows about their strengths and weaknesses. There is no mystery about Vampires, except perhaps whether they truly exist or not. Everyone knows everything about them. Right?
</p>

<p>
Sort of.
</p>

<h2>What are Vampires "About?"</h2>
<p>
Vampires aren't quite what people think, or rather people have a lot of misconceptions about what a Vampire is and what it is capable of doing. The most basic and most common misunderstanding of those who make such assumptions? That all Vampires are the same. Vampires aren't even all the same species, and instead only share the need to feed on mortals to survive. Each sub-species of Vampire is called a "Lineage" and each member of a Lineage can claim descent from a Founder (though in some cases the Founder is as much legend as fact). Each Lineage has unique strengths and weaknesses which separate them from other Lineages, though all are still Vampires. Below you will find a sampling of Vampiric Lineages that have been identified in the Portland area and have established Nests within the city.
</p>

<h2>How might a Vampire stereotype others?</h2>
<ul>
<li><i>Mages:</i> Upjumped humans with delusions of grandeur. Still, they can be useful. Just watch out for the old ones. They can be very dangerous.</li>
<li><i>Shifters:</i> No thank you. I mean, the few I've met seem decent enough if you don't mind the smell and the fleas. They mostly stick to the wilderness and we mostly stick to the shadows of the cities. It works well and we mostly stay out of each others hair. If one comes to you asking for help though, do it. They're into some strange thigns which if they involve you it is best to stay on their good side and help them out. You'll benefit in the long run. Probably. At least they won't eat you this way.</li>
<li><i>Wyrdlings:</i> You know, I had never even heard of these things since coming to the Valley? I guess they're faeries? Strange folks. I don't recommend feeding on them. It'll make a mess of your mind in the worst kinds of ways.</li>
<li><i>Ghosts:</i> I met some. I've made some. Unfortunate, but he ones who stick around usually do so for a reason. Help them if you can. Ignore them if you can't.</li>
<li><i>Mortals:</i> They are our source of sustenance. Some eat blood. Some eat sexual energy. I feed on death. They are important to us, but they are also our greatest threat. If they learn we exist, they will hunt us as they once did long ago. Stay quiet and hide in the shadows. Never take more than you need. We must remain hidden.</li>
<li><i>Legendaries:</i> "There are stranger things on heavens and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy Horatio..."</li>
</ul>
