<p>
Note: This list is far from exhaustive. There are many, many more Lineages in the world than what is listed here. These Lineages are simply those which are most common in the Western US, and individuals of other Lineages are not wholly unknown. If you wish to explore a different Lineage, please just chat with the Calyxs before diving in wholly with your idea.

<h2>Draculs</h2>
<ul>
	<li><i>Nicknames:</i> Hollywoods, Stokers, Schrecks, Bellas</li>
	<li><i>Progenitor:</i> Vlad Tepes (Disputed)</li>
	<li><i>Region of Origin:</i> Carpathian Mtns, Europe</li>
	<li><i>Inspiration:</i> Bram Stoker's <i>Dracula</i> and its derivatives, <i>Hammer Horror</i>, Vampires in general and Dracula specifically in <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>, Count von Count in <i>Sesame Street</i></li>
	<li><i>Summary:</i> The Draculs are the prototypical Vampire, at least in Western Culture. While no one is entirely sure how Mr. Stoker (and later Hollywood) got ahold of so much information about the Draculs and their ways, the simple truth is that when a modern American or European thinks of a Vampire, it's a Dracul they envision. The Dracul claim descent from Vlad Tepes, the real-life Count Dracula, and many claim he was made a Vampire by the Devil himself. Others point out that records of Draculs predate Count Tepes's birth and argue their progenitor is a much older creature. Regardless, they are one of the most common Vampires in the Western World by a significant margin.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cainites</h2>
<ul>
	<li><i>Nicknames:</i> Murderers, Red Hands (as in "caught red handed"), Qaynite (archaic)</li>
	<li><i>Progenitor:</i> Cain (The first murderer of Biblical myth)</li>
	<li><i>Region of Origin:</i> The Levant (Middle East)</li>
	<li><i>Inspiration:</i> Hannibal Lector of <i>Silence of the Lambs</i>, Black Annis of English Myth, Koschei the Deathless of Slavic Myth, Dybbuk of Jewish Myth, Gorgons of Greek Myth, Lamia of North African Myth</li>
	<li><i>Summary:</i> Cainites claim descent from Cain himself, brother of Abel and the first murderer. Those believing this claim literally regard the "Mark of Cain" placed as punishment for the murder was the Curse of Vampirism and the origin of their line. Many dispute this claim, but no other possible progenitors have come been realistically presented as an alternative. Regardless of origin, the Cainites bear a curse unique among Vampires: they are inherently social creatures (with abilities which give them tremendous influence over Mortals), but the world itself seems to reject their presence. They suffer a hatred that not only turns their friends and allies against them, but also drives aways animals and kills plant-life. God has rejected them, and thus so does the world itself...
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Jianshi</h2>
<ul>
	<li><i>Nicknames:</i> Jiangshi (more accurate), Goeng-shi Hoppers</li>
	<li><i>Progenitor:</i> Yiwu the Ancient</li>
	<li><i>Region of Origin:</i> China</li>
	<li><i>Inspiration:</i> Vampire from the <i>Jackie Chan Adventures</i> episode "Chi of the Vampire," Jiangshi from <i>Dragon Ball Super<i>, Nightwalker Heartless from <i>Kingdom Hearts</i>, Mantis enemies from <i>Sly Cooper<i> games</li>
	<li><i>Summary:</i> Yiwu the Ancient was not cursed nor blessed by another, but instead earned his place amongst the Vampires through sheer force of will. Yiwu was a traveling merchant killed by bandits in 1634 and, his Hun (Soul) was weighed down by his life's greed and descended into Diyu (Hell). There he suffered for untold ages as time is unknowable in that terrible place. He was slow to atone due to his pride and eventually he escaped Diyu. Fleeing to the Mortal world, Yiwu returned to his corpse and rose again. It took him many nights to realize he had only been gone for ten years before his return to undeath, and many more before he realized he could create "children" through "ritual damnation." While Yiwu wasn't the first Jiangshi, he was the first to create a Lineage all his own. Today all Jianhsi are either descended directly from Yiwu (who is one of the few Progenitors still active) or are "adopted" through a forced ritual. Yiwu does not allow "rogue Jianshi" to live.

</ul>

<h2>Civateo</h2>
<ul>
	<li><i>Nicknames:</i> Civatateo (more accurate), Nobles, Moon Children</li>
	<li><i>Progenitor:</i> Unknown (even to Civateo)</li>
	<li><i>Region of Origin:</i> Central America</li>
	<li><i>Inspiration:</i> Chupacabra of Central American myth, La Llorona of Mexican Myth, Tlahuelpuchi of Tiaxcala myth, Braijira from <i>Tensou Sentai Goseiger</i></li>
	<li><i>Summary:</i> The Civateo are ancient, with some claiming their Lineage is as ancient as the Cainites. Others point to their name and traditions seeming to trace to the early years of the Aztec Empire, which would make them less than half a millenia old. Few gravitate to either extreme and most instead claim to be "old, very old" and leave it at that. The unknown nature of their progenitor, beyond her pact with the Moon Goddess and subsequent abandonment of her duty which led to her (and her Lineage's) curse of Vampirism, only compounds the confusion. Today, the Lineage is divided. Half wish to return to their progenitor's duty and seek atonement through loyal service of the Moon Goddess and protection of sacred sites (and strict observance of the ancient tradition of only creating female Civateo). The other half ignore their past and their progenitor and instead look to the future, adopting communities and neighborhoods across North and Central America to protect (and ignore the traditions and welcome both male and female Civateo).

<h2>Strigoi</h2>
<ul>
	<li><i>Nicknames:</i> Rusulka, Stryzga, Varkolak
	<li><i>Progenitor:</i> Jure Grando Alilović</li>
	<li><i>Region of Origin:</i> Eastern Europe</li>
	<li><i>Inspiration:</i> Ordo Dracul in <i>Vampire the Requiem</i>, Veronica from <i>Vampironica</i>, Lady Alcina Dimitrescu from <i>Resident Evil Village</i>,Varcolac from <i>Hellboy</i>, Thuringwethil from <i>The Simarillion</i>, The Strix of Greco-Roman Myth </li>
	<li><i>Summary:</i> According to tradition there are two types of beings referred to as Strigoi. The first one are the living Strigoi. These are otherwise normal Mages who have fallen to dark powers.The second type, of which these Vampires are theorized to be related, are dead Mages who rise from their graves. Legends vary, but most commonly the lingering magic of a dead Mage allows the Strigoi to shapeshift, turn invisible, and retain a single spell or set of spells they knew in life. These vampires transform into animals by rolling over on the ground three times in order to shift into their animal form. They are very dangerous, because they can suck the blood out of anyone who doesn’t protect their body with garlic. Those who the Strigoi has tasted their blood can never escape them again without elaborate rituals involving bathing in Garlic infused water, covering windows, doors and chimneys with blessed cloth for seven days and nights. Supposedly, unlike other vampires who use blood ritual to convert their victims, the Strigoi need only to have tasted the blood of a victim and the proper rituals not being observed in the following week, after which the victim will die and rise on the 8th night as a Strigoi themselves.
