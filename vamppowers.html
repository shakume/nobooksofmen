<h2>Powers and Weaknesses Common to all Vampiric Lineages</h2>

<h4>Powers</h4>

<ul>
	<li><i>Enhanced Physical Attributes:</i> Every Vamp is the proverbial million dollar Vamp. They can run faster, jump higher, lift more, and endured more than they ever could when they were alive. As a general rule, Vampires are twice as physically capable than they were pre-mortem.</li>
	<li><i>Regeneration:</i> A Vampire who sleeps with a full stomach always rises with all wounds healed. Even if a bloody or burnt mess is what lays down to rest, so long as they have sufficient blood/essence in their system, they will look the same as the day they died when they next rise</li>
	<li><i>Predator's Gaze:</i> When a Vampire locks eyes with its victim, the poor soul is transfixed for a moment. Not unlike a serpent's gaze, the victim cannot look away from the eyes of the predator's stare. This is temporary at best, most shaking it off after a minute or so, but that usually gives the Vampire plenty of time to go in for a quick bite...</li>
</ul>

<h4>Weaknesses</h4>

<ul>
	<li><i>Dismemberment:</i> Not so much a weakness as a limitation. While Vampires can heal from almost any injury, they cannot regrow any lost limb. Be it finger, hand, or arm they cannot regrow what is removed wholesale. Any such limb crumbles to dust in an instant and will never return no matter how long the Vamp lives. The exception to this is the neck/head. When that is removed, the whole Vamp crumbles to dust as Death finally claims them.</li>
	<li><i>The Hunger:</i> Vampires must feed to survive and, while most can eat food as normal, only living human essence can sustain them. Most Vampires literally feed on the blood of their victims, though a few have been known to feed on other bodily fluids or even the essence (i.e. Soul) of their victim. Regardless of its source, every Vampire must feed at least once per night simply to survive. They need not kill their victim (in fact, prudent Vampires will avoid doing so), but they must consume about two pints (or more, for more ancient Vamps) to survive, which from a single victim will leave them weak and disoriented for a day or so.</li>
	<li><i>Impalement:</i> A shot to the heart, assuming one does so with a chunk of wood, is always fatal regardless of Lineage. Some Vampires are resistant to certain species of tree, while other are so allergic to a type of wood (Hawthorne goes through Draculs like a hot knife through butter). Some can be killed by other substances through the heart, such as certain metals, but in every case a chunk of wood piercing the heart will kill. The rest is just details...</li>
</ul>
	
<h2>Powers and Weaknesses of the Dracul</h2>

<h4>Powers</h4>

<ul>
	<li><i>Preternatural Beauty:</i> Draculs benefit from being undead. At the time of death, their body undergoes a transformation. Blemishes fade away, bone structure shifts, eye colors intensify, and other minor tweaks that make the Dracul's body into a perfected version of what it was in life. This beauty makes attracting their preferred prey (i.e. young human beings) much easier.</li>
	<li><i>Shapeshifting:</i> Draculs have the ability to change themselves into two different forms, a wolf and a bat. In both cases, the Vampire truly becomes the creature in all ways but mentality, but their undead nature is still obvious as the animal forms look greasy and unhealthy. Alternate forms are also not immune to the weaknesses of the Dracul (both standard and Lineage specific).</li>
	<li><i>Thrall:</i> A Dracul can shackle the soul of a single individual to serve them as a Thrall. They draw the soul out of the Thrall and enclose it in some sort of container. As long as the Thrall's soul is thus contained, the Thrall must obey the Dracul's commands without question but is otherwise a normal human being. If the container is opened/destroyed than the Thrall regains its free will and if the Thrall dies its soul is free to move on to its afterlife. <i>((Note: PCs cannot be Thralled without the express permission of both players.))</i>i</li>
</ul>

<h4>Weaknesses</h4>

<ul>
	<li><i>Compulsive Counting:</i> A Dracul presented with a significant number of small objects (at least two dozen), must stop what they are doing and count these objects. While this can easily stall a Dracul long enough to save a victim from predation, it <i>does not</i> risk death. Stereotypically, this compulsion can kill if done near sunrise, but survival instincts are stronger than the compulsion and the Dracul will abandon its counting if risking deadly exposure.</li>
	<li><i>Repelled by Religious Objects:</i> A Dracul cannot harm anyone who places an object relating to their religion (e.g. A Christian with a Crucifix or a Jew with a Star of David, but not a Buddhist with a Crucifix). It causes no pain/harm from contact and will not stop a Vampire from harming the wielder, but it will prevent the Vampire from physically approaching. Note: This works on homes too and prevents the Vampire from entering, but only when the religious icon is publically and intentionally displayed.</li>
	<li><i>Sunlight:</i> The Sun is anathema to the Vampire. When it shines in the sky, the Vampire cannot walk out in the open or face terrible burns and even possible death. Draculs are still free to stay awake and walk in places where sunlight cannot touch them, but many (particularly older) Draculs avoid doing so as even a second's exposure to sunlight is akin to shoving one's hand in a blast furnace. Thus, most Draculs sleep through the day to avoid both risk and boredom.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Powers and Weaknesses of the Cainites</h2>

<h4>Powers</h4>

<ul>
	<li><i>Enflame the Blood:</i> Cainites take the blame for everything, leading to many witchhunts over the decades. To survive, Cainites often find they need a distraction to escape, and Enflame the Blood gives them an easy method of doing so. Enflame the blood isn't capable of true mind control, but it allows the Cainite to send its victims into a mindless rage. With a bit of practice and skill, the Cainite can Enflame a crowd against a single target, but far more often this anger is generalized to whichever warm body is closest to the victim. Barfights to Riots have been started with Enflame. Enflame lasts only a minute, but in that minute the victim is so enraged that they cannot tell friend from foe and will attack anything that moves. A minute is usually enough...</li>
	<li><i>Shepherd the Weak:</i> With a song in his heart and a spring in his step, the Cainite using this power can control mortals and direct them to his whim. Much like the Pied Piper of legend, the Cainite can direct the actions of mortals (up to 5 at a time) like a conductor directs and orchestra. To maintain control, the Cainite must continuously perform some sort of music; humming, singing, playing an instrument, or any other form of music will do as long as it is produced by the Cainite himself (in other words: a boombox wouldn't work, but certain forms of DJing might). Mortals so enthralled will break free when the song ends or after 30 minutes, whichever happens first, and cannot be directed to any action which may lead to self-harm or is outright contradictory to the individual's morality (i.e. a nun can't be forced to cannibalize her sisters).</li>
	<li><i>Unnatural Endurance:</i> Cain was cursed by God sure, but the Mark of Cain was also a reminder to all he met that he belonged to God directly and thus any who harmed him would answer to God. Even the Earth itself would not harm Cain, stones would not bruise him and the sun would not burn him. His Vampire descendents benefit from this protection in the form of unnatural resilience and resistance to damage. The Sun does not harm them (though it is uncomfortable under the "Eye of God"), and weapons seem weaker against the Cainite. Swords (excluding enchanted blades) only cut half as deep. Small caliber bullets glance off and only leave a bruise, while higher caliber bullets only do half the damage they should. This leads some to speak of ancient Cainites being able to even eternally cheat death, but that is pure legend... Isn't it...?</li>
</ul>

<h4>Weaknesses</h4>

<ul>
	<li><i>Curse of Hatred:</i> People always assume the worst of a Cainite. If someone breaks something in a room with a Cainite, the Cainite gets the blame. If there's any connection between a Cainite and a murder victim, the police suspect the Cainite. If there is any reasonable way to think the Cainite is responsible for a terrible act, mortals who know of him will automatically assume the Cainite is the culprit.</li>
	<li><i>Curse of the Field:</i> Wherever a Cainite walks, plants wither. When just passing through a field or across a park, this causes the grasses and other plants to wilt and grow sickly but they will not die (and will perk up with the next rainfall). Any place where a Cainite lives for more than a day will kill the surrounding foliage. Typically, this drives Cainites to make their homes in abandoned homes where a dead/dying yard will be less noticed.
</li>
	<li><i>Curse of the Flock:</i> Animals flee from the Cainite. Insects avoid those killed by the Cainite. Even humans are unnerved by the Cainite's presence, but can't quite place why. They cross the street to avoid passing a Cainite, or avoid leaving friends when a Cainite is nearby at a night club. This makes hunting much more difficult.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Powers and Weaknesses of the Jianshi</h2>

<h4>Powers</h4>

<ul>
	<li><i>Catch the Breath:</i> Jianshi can sense any living creature within 10 yards without fail, but only if the creature is currently breathing. If it is a creature which breathes (i.e. not an insect, but any other animal) and it is not holding its breath when the Jianshi is searching the area, the Jianshi can find it. Jianshi can also instinctively differentiate the "noise" of other creatures in the area, and thus even sense its human prey in a rat infested basement (for example).</li>
	<li><i>Soul Drinker:</i> Jianshi do not need to drink blood, and instead can feed on the literal life force of its victims. Typically, they do this by holding down their victim and "kissing" them, which draws out their life essence. Just like with blood, they need not kill their victim, but as no physical harm is caused there is no evidence. Plus, by consuming Yang energy (i.e. Soul) the Jianshi can temporarily (for the first hour after feeding) ignore their "Stiffness" weakness.</li>
	<li><i>Tongue Lashing:</i> Jianshi have the ability to extend their tongue up to five feet and this appendage is wholly prehensile. It is strong enough to lift a human adult off the ground and has enough gripping force to choke the life out of a victim.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Weaknesses</h4>

<ul>
	<li><i>Fear of the Sun:</i> Jianshi are not notably damaged by sunlight, but it is both uncomfortable and terrifying to them. When the sun rises, the Jianshi are forced to flee in terror to the nearest shaded or enclosed space. Typically, they will gravitate towards caves and sewers if caught in the sunlight, but most will wisely head to their (often lavish) homes long before the sunrise.</li>
	<li><i>Prayer Strips:</i> Jianshi can be bound in one place or even compelled to perform a simple task (can fit on a strip of paper no larger than 2x8 inches) by affixing a strip of paper with traditional Chinese calligraphy written in handmade black ink. Tradition states that only Taoist priests are capable of doing this (just as the Jianshi want it), but anyone (even mortals) can do this if they have the proper materials. Taoist priests (specifically those who are Mages) know of arcane methods of this practice which allow the priest to enslave the Jianshi instead of issuing simple and temporary commands.</li>
	<li><i>Stiffness:</i> Jianshi are not wholly immune to [i]rigor mortis[/i] and while their undead state allow full motion and action, they lack the preternatural speed of their Vampiric cousins of other Lineages. The supernatural levels of other attributes are unaffected.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Powers and Weaknesses of the Civateo</h2>

<h4>Powers</h4>

<ul>
	<li><i>Go-Between:</i> When the Civateo were originally granted their eternal life by the Moon, they were tasked to act as go-betweens for the living and the dead. They would carry messages between families and their dead loved ones in exchange for respectful offerings. When their [b]((ancient progenitor))[/b] turned against her duty and was cursed to prey upon the living, they did not lose their ability to see, summon, and speak with the spirits.</li>
	<li><i>Touch of Death:</i> The Civateo are creatures of the Underworld. Traditionally, they served as Go-Betweens (see above) and "guardians" of the places where the walls between the worlds of the Living and the Dead are weak. They were charged with keeping ghosts in the Underworld and Mortals in the physical world, and thus they were granted the ability to cross the boundary between the two to better police the border. They still retain this ability, but because of their undead curse they are no longer able to enter any Spirit Realm but the Underworld.</li>
	<li><i>Touch of Life:</i> While the Civateo are still undead in the sense that they are neither living nor dead, but they are closer to the "living" end of the spectrum than most Vampires. The Civateo still have a heartbeat (albeit a weak one), and their skin is still warmer than room temp. This state of being closer to life give the Civateo certain other perks, meaning they can still more easily empathize with living mortals and in rare cases even procreate.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Weaknesses</h4>

<ul>
	<li><i>Bribes:</i> Civateos may not harm anyone who provides them with an offering, traditionally breads in the form of butterflies and this is the only offering a Civateo [i]must[/i] accept. Other offerings which a Civateo may accept are trinkets, religious icons, or even money.</li>
	<li><i>Horrific Appearance:</i>  A Civateo's natural form is horrific to look upon. Gaunt and corpse-like, with talon like hands covered in chalk and skin that cracks and peels. A Civateo may hide their true face beneath a glamour (and typically does), but supernatural senses can pierce the illusion and the illusion fails automatically when the Civateo is stressed (such as facing death).</li>
	<li><i>Sunlight:</i> As "children of the moon," the Civateos are not well loved by the sun. Their already cracking skin begins to turn to ash and fall away. After only a few minutes in the sunlight, only bones remain atop a pile of ash.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Powers and Weaknesses of the Strigoi</h2>

<h4>Powers</h4>

<ul>
	<li><i> :</i> Strigoi have the ability to change themselves into any animal form of their choice. Regardless of form, the Vampire truly becomes the creature in all ways but mentality, but their undead nature is still obvious as the animal glows with a faint "moonglow" that is clearly unnatural. Alternate forms are also not immune to the weaknesses of the Strigoi (both standard and Lineage specific).</li>
	<li><i>Invisibility:</i> So long as they are unperceived and out of direct light, the Strigoi may shift into a mist-like form which quickly becomes imperceptible to all mortal detection. Even magic which can be used to detect the unseen will often fail to detect an invisible Strigoi. Sunlight will always permanently break this invisibility and it cannot be initiated under direct light or being watched by a sentient being</li>
	<li><i>Magic Trick:</i> Upon becoming a Strigoi, whatever spell or set of (related) spells which the Strigoi knew in life will be approximated by their undead nature. In the case of a mortal or an individual with no common affinity, this will default to an ability to wither plantlife and spoil food whenever desired.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Weaknesses</h4>

<ul>
	<li><i>Allergy to Garlic:</i> Strigoi are always repelled by the smell and sight of garlic. If this makes contact with their skin, the Strigoi's flesh will singe and burn as if touched with a hot iron.</li>
	<li><i>Blight:</i> Wherever a Strigoi walks, plants wither. When just passing through a field or across a park, this causes the grasses and other plants to wilt and grow sickly but they will not die (and will perk up with the next rainfall). Any place where a Strigoi lives for more than a day will kill the surrounding foliage. Typically, this drives Strigoi to make their homes in abandoned homes where a dead/dying yard will be less noticed.</li>
	<li><i>Cannot Cross Salt:</i> Lines of salt stop a Strigoi and its magic from operating beyond mortal ken and a line of salt might as well be an invisible forcefield preventing any mystic or physical ability of the Strigoi.</li>
</ul>
