<h2>Conspiracies</h2>
<p>
Many folks, especially Magi, are members of one Conspiracy or another because doing so is a sign of status among them. Vampires don't call their groups "Conspiracies" and prefer to call them "Cabals" instead, but the concepts are tremendously similar. Werewolves tend to gather in "Packs" which are also similar, but tend to be much larger and loosely organized. Wyrdlings have dozens of names for such groupings, but they tend to agree that "Conspiracy" works as well as any for such groups. While mixing between the various species are rare, such "cross-species" groups do exist as well.
</p>
<p>
The basic idea behind a Conspiracy is simple: A group of individuals organized towards a common purpose. This can mean as few as two individuals gathering for friendship or as many as thousands organized to manipulate global politics/media. All that identifies a Conspiracy as such is a purpose and more than one member.
</p>
<ul>
	<h3><li><i>"Cabal":</i> </h3>
		<p>The smallest and most common type of Conspiracy amongst Vampires is the Cabal. A cabal, sometimes called a Clan or other similar terms, is essentially just a group of 2-5 shifters who associate and work together for various tasks. These tasks can be mundane, magical, or both. This is basically a group of friends who also happen know each other's mystic inclinations as well of social preferences. Each Cabal claims a "territory" that they guard from the presence of other Vampires.</p></li>
	<h3><li><i>The Columbiana Nest:</i> </h3>
		<p>Existing since roughly 1870, the Columbiana Nest has Thrived in a place largely hostile to Vampires. Most point to the long standing Accord with the Mages of the Columbiana (and formerly the Ambrosiana) Valleys as part of the nest's long standing success at minimizing the often deadly natures of Vampires. It is a large and stable nest ruled by Liliana Vasa, the only Vampire to have existed in Columbiana for her entire unlife of nearly two centuries.</p></li>
	<h3><li><i>Sundown Holdings, LLC:</i></h3>
		<p>Abraham Wright was born a slave, but freed before turning 15. He headed West to make a fortune and by the time he was 25 he owned his own business, catering to the Black Hills Gold Rushers. Knowing that it was only a matter of time before that income dried up, Abe looked further west to Colorado and the Pacific Northwestt. A hunch led him to use his profits to buy land all over the area for his hotels. Moving to Portland, near the center of his string of locations, Abe finally caught the attention of his sire. Having become a Cainite, Abe proved his worth a decade later when the Yukon Gold Rush made him immensely wealthy.</p>

<p>As the decades rolled by, Abe rose higher and higher in the ranks of the region's Cainites as his small empire made him increasingly wealthy. Finally, in the late 1960s he made a power play and replaced his own sire as the <i>de facto</i> leader of the Cainites in the region, a position only bolstered by his minor influence in the territories of other Nests from Portland to Denver. Since then, he has taken on the role of "den mother" of the local Cainites and even other Vampiric Lineages who chafe under the more direct leadership of other Nests.

	<h3><li><i>S.E.L.F.:</i></h3>
		<p> According to SELF, the problem isn't the Exalted Order. It isn't the Kindly Ones. It isn't even the “Mortals.” It's the supernaturals themselves. They think themselves so much better than “mere mortals,” yet they hide themselves away. They tell themselves that the fight against the cold, superiority of the Exalted or the Wyld chaos of the Faerie Lords. Instead, SELF claims, everyone needs to realize that supernaturals have been nothing but a bunch of hypocrites. If “mortals” are truly capable of learning to coexist with supernaturals, as proven by the “locals,” why not now? If they can learn magic like the philosophers say, why wait? We need to stop hiding in the shadows and take things to the streets!</p></li>
