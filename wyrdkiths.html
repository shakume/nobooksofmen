<h2>Kiths</h2>

<p>
Kiths are not truly a lineage, shared history, or any real connection between Wyrdlings. In fact, most Wyrdlings doubt whether they would have developed such classifications on their own, but as they've interacted with Mages over the years they have found the imposed classifciations useful to categorize the wildly varied natures of Wyrdlings.
</p>

<h2>Beasts</h2>
<ul>
	<li><i>Nicknames:</i> Wyldkin, Wyld Ones, Beasts</li>
	<li><i>"In-a-Nutshell":</i> Flora or Fauna Wyrdlings</li>
	<li><i>Inspiration:</i> Satyrs, Pixies, Mermaids</li>
	<li><i>Summary:</i> Beasts are connected to the animal world. They come in many shapes and sizes, and may be tied to a particular type of animal, an animalistic concept, or even an animal that never existed in the real world. All of them were used by their Keepers as animals in one form or another, and they all bear at least some bestial features. Many were innocents, lured into the Hedge by the tempting excitement of the wild, but regardless, they felt the pull and power of raw instinct and sensation. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Darklings</h2>
<ul>
	<li><i>Nicknames:</i> Creepers, Skulkers, Shade Children</li>
	<li><i>"In-a-Nutshell":</i> The things that go bump in the night</li>
	<li><i>Inspiration:</i> Sluah, Gargoyles, Will-o-Wisps</li>
	<li><i>Summary:</i> Darklings are forever tainted by shadow and darkness. As they often resemble folk tale creatures of the night or underground: grave-wights, banshees, kobolds, and weirder things. Every one of them is unsettling in appearance, with many gaunt, tall and thin. Whether experimented upon, chained in a factory as slave labor or simply tossed in a dungeon and forgotten by their Keepers, all Darklings were kept from the light of Faerie. Their memories of their durance are usually filled with foreboding; fears sensed and ever-present but never revealed. Many Darklings share a sense of curiosity. Most crossed some kind of line that brought them to Faerie, whether they are aware of the nature of their transgression or not. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Elementals</h2>
<ul>
	<li><i>Nicknames:</i> X-Kin (where X is the element, such as Flamekin or Stonekin)</li>
	<li><i>"In-a-Nutshell":</i> Golems and Dryads</li>
	<li><i>Inspiration:</i> Rock Giants, Dryads, Nixies, Djinn</li>
	<li><i>Summary:</i> While most other Lost became the way they did through simply living in a faerie's home and eating faerie food and doing faerie work, the Elementals were often deliberately changed, transformed into slaves of some kind or another, or features of the land until one day, they awoke to themselves and realized they had to escape. The Elementals were often those whom the Fae desired in some way, those whom they sought out and went to some effort to kidnap. Most were already exceptional in some way. Perhaps the wyrdling was beautiful enough to excite a faerie's desire. Perhaps they needed a guard or a servant of some kind. A musician or dancer could become the prize of a Fae who fancied himself a doyen of the arts. When they come back, they still possess those talents that attracted the Fae to them in the first place, but now their element alters it in many ways, some subtle, some less so. Some, however, wandered into the Hedge on their own, in some ways bearing the marks of whatever thorny wasteland they wandered in before being taken to Faerie. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Fairest</h2>
<ul>
	<li><i>Nicknames:</i> Sidhe, Fae-Touched</li>
	<li><i>"In-a-Nutshell":</i> Elves and Victorian Faeries</li>
	<li><i>Inspiration:</i> Pixies, Muses, Succubi, "Noble Beasts" (i.e. Dragons, Unicorns, etc)</li>
	<li><i>Summary:</i> The Fairest are wyrdlings for whom Faerie should have been - and in some sense was - bright and wonderful. They embody the wonder and beauty ever-present in folklore: the elves, the Shining Ones, the fairy maidens and dashing fairy knights. But theirs is a beauty not of this world; they are wondrous to look on, but they're too perfect. Their faces may be too symmetrical, or their features impossibly angular or chiseled; perhaps they literally glow with a warm light. They are still wyrdlings, and their true forms are still inhuman. The Fairest are frequently taken for their beauty, but usually this is not the only reason. Each has some other quality or talent that attracted their Keeper, most often artistic skill or the ability to play music or perform. Since this skill becomes their sole reason for their existence in Faerie, Fairest sometimes become obsessed with it, desperate to prove their worth. They are, however, almost without exception supremely social creatures, used to admiration and hungry for approval. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Giants</h2>
<ul>
	<li><i>Nicknames:</i> Monsters, Trolls, Giants</li>
	<li><i>"In-a-Nutshell":</i> Fee-Fi-Fo-Fum</li>
	<li><i>Inspiration:</i> Trolls, Cyclops, Oni, Redcaps</li>
	<li><i>Summary:</i>Ogres resemble the big, brutish figures of folklore, like the troll under the bridge or the Cyclops of Greek myth. Ogres serve as guards, gladiators, and heavy laborers in Arcadia because of their outstanding strength.Due to their hardiness, Ogres endure particularly vicious and bloody Durances. Once back in the real world, Ogres are stereotyped as universally dumb, but are feared for their prowess nonetheless.Ogres are big and imposing figures. Some are kidnapped because of their size and strength and are honed to frightening proportions in Arcadia. Some are taken because they were already cruel and intimidating in the mortal world, and could be used as weapons by the Fae.  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Wizened</h2>
<ul>
	<li><i>Nicknames:</i> Experts, Smiths, House Elves</li>
	<li><i>"In-a-Nutshell":</i> Brownies and other "worker Elves"</li>
	<li><i>Inspiration:</i> Domovoi, Gremlin, Faerie Craftsmen</li>
	<li><i>Summary:</i> Wizened are those wyrdlings who embody the "little people" and "wise men" of fairy myth. They are unmatched artisans and tinkerers, and generally excel at a particular skill or occupation, whether butler or artisan, clerk or fortune teller. While they always seem like "little people", the Wizened are not necessarily small in size: some may be tall and thin, but walk with a stoop, while others may be normally proportioned yet give the feeling that there's somehow less of them. The Wizened often seem to have less in common than other Seemings - they come from a diverse number of backgrounds. Many were taken on a whim or stumbled into the Hedge through bad luck. They may have served any number of functions for their Keepers or merely been the butt of cruel "jokes", but they are without exception known for their cunning and nimbleness - traits necessary to escape the clutches of the true Little People.  </li>
