<h2>What is a Wyrdling?</h2>
<p>
What are Wyrdlings? They are, in many ways, as familiar to us as Werewolves or Mages, but in others are something altogether different. In a word: Wyrdlings are Faeries.
</p>

<p>
Of course, things aren't quite that simple. The association is clear and definite, both in universe and out. Wyrdlings are the closest thing to traditional Faeries in this setting and are often considered one and the same by students of the occult in this world. The problem arises when people take this too literally. After all, in this world, Faeries don't exist but the Elder Ones do...
</p>

<p>
Wyrdlings are those unfortunate mortals who have been exposed to the power and madness of the utterly alien Elder Ones. In brief, the Elder Ones are "things" which predate this (and every) universe and sustain themselves by consuming universes. When a universe is consumed by an Elder One, that universe becomes a part of and begins to reflect the nature of said Elder One. 
</p>

<h2>What are Wyrdlings "About?"</h2>
<p>
Most Wyrdlings are those unfortunates which were either abducted or wandered into the universe "recently" consumed by the Elder One known as Arcadius. Still others have lately been affected by the emanations of the Elder One which broke (partially) into our world in Colorado. Regardless of source, Wyrdlings are the mortals who have been trapped within the influence of an Elder One and has since escaped back to the mortal world. They are no longer human, but they aren't wholly alien either. Most seem to conform to mortal understanding of "faeries" (with gossamer wings or ogre-like strength), but others defy such descriptions. Every Wyrdling is unique in form and ability, which often defies expectations of those who think of them as "Faeries" but its the closest thing mortals (and some Mages) have to a label for them, so it continues...
</p>

<h2>How might a Wyrdling stereotype others?</h2>
<ul>
<li><i>Mages:</i> These guys are into some weird shit. Like mad powerful, man. Most seem like good people, but be careful. Some think of us like science experiments. Also, I think some of our kind can be wizards too? I at least know one Wyrdling that can do magic. I dunno if it's the same thing though.</li>
<li><i>Shifters:</i> I like these guys. I'm a big bull-man. The guy I met is a big wolf-man. I think we might be related somehow, but the shifters are a bit different. Not sure how. But they get us in ways that most of the others don't.</li>
<li><i>Vampires:</i> I was not happy to find out these things are real. Creepy as fuck though. Might explain some of the weird shit I saw when I was in the Gulf though. Locals called them Ghuls and told us soldiers not to get too close to graveyards at night. Thought it was bunk, but still... I saw some spooky shit on night watch. Now that I know they might be real? Ugh. Creepy.</li>
<li><i>Ghosts:</i> Ghosts? Like dead people? I mean, I've never seen one. Doesn't mean they ain't real though. I mean. I didn't think minotaurs actually existed either, now I am one...</li>
<li><i>Mortals:</i> Used to be one. Kinda wish I still was. But they're innocent. Let's keep it that way.</li>
<li><i>Legendaries:</i> I wonder how many of these used to be human...</li>
</ul>
