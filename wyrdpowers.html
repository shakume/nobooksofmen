<h2>Common Traits</h2>

<h4>Powers</h4>

<ul>
	<li><i>Conspicuous Consumption:</i> All Wyrdlings, regardless of form or ability, must consume some form of "strange" essence to sustain themselves. They can (and often do) eat mortal substances, but this is not what keeps them alive. What they eat often directly corresponds to their new forms, but not always. A Stoneform may eat crystals while a Bookworm might require consuming literal books to survive. Alternatively, a Beauty may need to drink virginal blood to maintain their youthful and beautiful appearance (and their life).</li>
	<li><i>Glamour:</i> Wyrdlings aren't human and (with very few exceptions) don't even look human any more. Some are covered in thick fur and adorned with enormous antlers. Others possess beaks and wings. Still others appear to be mechanical automatons or monstrous brutes. Very few could pass for human on a good day, but their Glamour protects them. A specific and immediate form of the Mists, Glamour hides the supernatural traits behind an illusionary mask which appears human. While instinctively created by all Wyrdlings, Glamours take some time to develop when a Wyrdling returns to the mortal world. As the Mists begin to surround the Wyrdling and they start to remember what it was to be human (and who they were before becoming a Wyrdling), the Glamour is created over the course of 1-3 days. Once the Glamour is built it remains forever, but the Wyrdling can banish the Glamour temporarily and reveal her true form at will. When the Glamour is removed, any who see the Wyrdling in its true form is shocked and horrified (or awed if Unnatural Beauty is taken). Most supernatural creatures are simply surprised, but Mortals are stunned/terrified for at least a minute.</li>
	<li><i>Mists:</i> The Mists are both a blessing and a curse. The Mists make mortals forget things. All Wyrdlings unconsciously make mortals forget anything supernatural they might learn about the Wyrdling and this can never be fully negated. With practice and control, the Wyrdling can allow some small detail to remain in the mind of a mortal (such as the fact the Wyrdling isn't human) but details will always fade when the mortal is distanced from the Wyrdling. All such forgotten memories return when exposed to the Wyrdling again, but only near that Wyrdling. Other supernaturals are affected by the Mists, but to a much lesser degree. The paranormal state of being a Vampire or a Mage is sufficiently "wyrd" that the Mists don't erase memories but details still fade. Such creatures will remember the Wyrdling and its nature, but might forget its name or the color of its plumage when seperated from that individual.</li>
	<li><i>Unsettling:</i> Something's not right about Wyrdlings and people know it. Very rare is the individual with the ability to see through a Glamour and rarer still the one which can remember through the Mists (in both cases one must generally be supernatural themselves). Just because a person can't see or remember [i]why[/i] doesn't mean they don't [i]feel[/i] that something is wrong. While this doesn't manifest as anger, accusations, or any other such emotional states Unsettling ensures that people aren't comfortable around Wyrdlings. They cross the street to avoid Wyrdlings, but when asked can't say what made them nervous. They stand as far away from a Wyrdling when stuck in a line next to one, but can't quite place why they're weirded out. There is no particular system to this, and indeed some people are [i]attracted[/i] to the strange and Unsettling, but it is worth pointing out that people are ill-at-ease around Wyrdlings.</li>
</ul>
	
<h2>Powers and Weaknesses of the Dracul</h2>

<p>
Use these traits to "create" your Wyrdling's abilities and appearance. Each will list an "advantage," a "weakness," and a set of example "appearances." You may choose <b>two to four</b>.
</p>

<h4>Blast</h4>

<ul>
	<li><i>Advantage:</i> Grants the Wyrdling the ability to expel some sort of energy or weapon from his person. Generally this is used as a form of attack, but in some circumstances can be used for other purposes (i.e. flame breath to start a fire, eye beams to cut a rope, etc). The exact form of the Blast is chosen at creation and under 99% of circumstances cannot be changed. Example include (but are not limited to): Flame Breath, Concussive Eye Blasts, Poison Breath, Swarms of Insects projected from the hands, or even a canon which shoot freeze rays attached at the shoulder.</li>
	<li><i>Weakness:</i> Whatever the chosen form of "blast" is, it is privy to the same weaknesses of its "element." A beekeeper's suit could stop a swarm. Enough water will prevent Flame Breath from burning anything. Steel walls would stop Concussive Eye Blasts. And so on... Additionally, unless obtained from another trait, the Wyrdling is [i]not[/i] immune to their own blasts. So a Flame Breath turned back against the Wyrdling will burn them. </li>
	<li><i>Appearance:</i> Every blast type is unique, but is usually strange or grotesque. Flame Breath may manifest as glowing embers replacing teeth or flames always flickering in their mouth. Swarms of insects builld "nests" inside the body of the Wyrdling's arms between Blasts. Eye Blasts might come out of empty eye sockets or out of a single enormous eye. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Brownie's Blessing</h4>

<ul>
	<li><i>Advantage:</i> Can create high quality crafts in record time, so long as unobserved. These items are of impeccable quality and can be used many times to full effect without failure. This ability typically allows the Wyrdling to create such quality items in a single evening, so long as they remain unobserved by any individual except others actively aiding with building the item. This ability does not grant any crafting ability, thus if the Wyrdling does not possess the required skill they cannot use this power to build that particular item unless aided by another which does (but this doubles the time unless said individual also has this trait).</li>
	<li><i>Weakness:</i> Beyond not working while observed, Brownie's Blessing breeds over reliance. Anyone (including the Wyrdling using this trait) who uses an item created with this trait marvels at the quality and speed of its creation and becomes "addicted" to such items. They arrogantly demand the creation of other such items and become reliant upon such items over any other item, trait, or ability. With each item thus created after the first, the items become increasingly low quality but any such flaws are ignored until a (potentially) fatal failure breaks the reverie.</li>
	<li><i>Appearance:</i> Jeweler's Loup/Monocle replaces one eye, Fingers change to tools (e.g. a finger replaced with a screwdriver), Mechanical sounding voice, or any other example of a body part replaced with (related) machines/tools.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Elemental Form (Choose <i>one</i> element.)</h4>

<ul>
	<li><i>Advantage:</i> 
	<ul>
		<li><i>Flameform:</i> Can burn objects on contact, heat immunity, can control any fire they touch.</li>
		<li><i>Stoneform:</i> Reduced damage (cut in half), crushing grip, heat/cold immunity.</li>
		<li><i>Waterform:</i> Reduced damage (cut in half), can control any liquid they touch, underwater breath</li>
		<li><i>Windform:</i> Can summon/control winds (up to 35mph), immunity to falling damage, limited (10mph) flight</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><i>Weakness:</i> <ul>
		<li><i>Flameform:</i> Damaged by water/cold, lose control of flame when contact lost</li>
		<li><i>Stoneform:</i> Heavy (ex: running cracks pavement), Slowed healing</li>
		<li><i>Waterform:</i> Damaged by heat, Can only heal in or underwater</li>
		<li><i>Windform:</i> Double damage from non-physical sources, Light (ex. Easily thrown)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><i>Appearance:</i> 
	<ul>
		<li><i>Flameform:</i> Body made of: flame, embers, magma, etc. Also can have "creature of fire" traits, such as: Salamanders, "Demons," Dragons, etc.</li>
		<li><i>Stoneform:</i> Body made of: stone, crystal, soil, etc. Also can have "creature of stone" traits, such as: Dwarves, Wurms (i.e. "Earth Dragons"), Golems, etc. </li>
		<li><i>Waterform:</i> Body made of: water, ice, snow, etc. Also can have "creature of Water" traits, such as: Mermaids, Rusalka, Kappa, etc.</li>
		<li><i>Windform:</i> Body made of: swirling winds, empty bandages (around "air body"), clouds, etc. Also can have "creature of fire" traits, such as: Birds, Some Dragons, "Angels," etc.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>Extra Limb</h4>

<ul>
	<li><i>Advantage:</i> The Wyrdling has some sort of limb which can act independently of her other limbs. In most cases, this limb takes the form of an arm or tentacle which is able to grasp objects and otherwise hold things (such as a weapon). As it can act independently of the other limbs, it can offer another "front" in combat or manipulate objects when the other limbs are occupied. This power can be taken multiple times and each time it is taken it adds one more limb.</li>
	<li><i>Weakness:</i> Most people find performing two separate actions (one with each hand) difficult without any sort of supernatural mutation. The addition of a third (or fourth, or fifth) limb only further divides the Wyrdling's attention. For each limb beyond the (natural) two, the effectiveness and dexterity of [i]all[/i] limbs are decreased. Three is better than two sure, but not by as much as you'd think...</li>
	<li><i>Appearance:</i> Arms, Tentacles, Tails, Long Tongue, etc</li>
</ul>

<h4>Heightened Sense(s)</h4>

<ul>
	<li><i>Advantage:</i> One or all senses are increased. Eyes see farther and/or can see at night. Ears hear further and in more detail. Scent increases to that of a bloodhound. Taste is refined to the point of being able to identify individual ingredients/chemicals in substances. Touch is strong enough to <i>almost</i> feel molecular differences. <i>Choose senses affected and their appearances at creation.</i></li>
	<li><i>Weakness:</i> Bright flashes, loud noises, potent odours, strong flavours, intense heat/cold, and other strong sensations can easily overwhelm the Wyrdling. Such powerful sensations stun the Wyrdling for a minute after exposure as their senses "adjust."</li>
	<li><i>Appearance:</i> 
	<ul>
		<li><i>Sight:</i> Larger eyes, lupine/feline/etc eyes, "glowing" eyes, etc</li>
		<li><i>Hearing:</i> Larger ears, Animal ears (ex: similar to a rabbit's or fox's), "satellite dishes," etc.</li>
		<li><i>Scent:</i> Animal nose (such as a dog's), Larger nose, etc</li>
		<li><i>Taste:</i> Large tongue, small hairs covering tongue, animal tongue (such as a snake's), etc.</li>
		<li><i>Touch:</i> Thin skin, short and sensitive hairs all over, circuitry covering skin, etc.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>Immense</h4>

<i>Note: Cannot be taken with "Tiny."</i>

<ul>
	<li><i>Advantage:</i> Strength and intimidation. The sheer size of the muscles makes the Wyrdling twice as strong as he would be otherwise. The majesty of a large creature makes the Wyrdling intimidating and awe inspiring enough that most (sane) individuals would hesitate to attack her.</li>
	<li><i>Weakness:</i> Weak circulatory system. The human body was never built to be this big and back in a world were physics works as intended, the body is stretched too thin. Unconsciousness comes easily and too rapid movement (without adrenaline or just after it fades) or strong blows to the head will easily render the Wyrdling unconscious.</li>
	<li><i>Appearance:</i> No new physical traits, but non-human form increases to 7-10 feet tall and/or weight rises to 300-750 lbs. The Wyrdling's Glamour is typically about 6.5 feet tall.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Iron Stomach</h4>

<ul>
	<li><i>Advantage:</i> The Wyrdling can chew, swallow, and digest any material he wishes. This provides nourishment like any food stuffs (though it doesn't necessarily cover Conspicuous Consumption unless its the "right" material) and also provides a tremendously intimidating tactic to shock and horrify.</li>
	<li><i>Weakness:</i> Eating inorganic material will cause tremendous intestinal distress a few hours after eating. Literally "shitting a brick" can be a very uncomfortable prospect. This trait makes such action non-lethal, but does nothing for comfort.</li>
	<li><i>Appearance:</i> Teeth made of iron, a maw of jagged and uneven teeth, no teeth at all, etc</li>
</ul>

<h4>Natural Armor</h4>

<ul>
	<li><i>Advantage:</i> Reduces damage taken from any non-piercing (bullets, arrows, spears, etc) weapon by half. Also reduces damage from one "natural" source (such as heat or cold) by half, chosen at creation.</li>
	<li><i>Weakness:</i> Whichever "natural" source is chosen, its opposite does double damage. So if cold is reduced, heat is twice as debilitating due to the thickness of fur/skin/etc. </li>
	<li><i>Appearance:</i> Thick Fur, Thick/Leathery Hide, Plates (think Armadillo), etc.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Natural Weapon</h4>

<ul>
	<li><i>Advantage:</i> Can cause damage without the use of a weapon, restricted by the location and muscles of the individual (can't "bite" with "horns").</li>
	<li><i>Weakness:</i> Cannot be "retracted" which often restricts movement, can easily damage unintentionally, and increases "Unsettling" trait to the point of "Distrust"</li>
	<li><i>Appearance:</i> Claws, Fangs, Horns, Talons, Spines, etc</li>
</ul>

<h4>Savant</h4>

<ul>
	<li><i>Advantage:</i> Savant allows the Wyrdling to tap into knowledge she doesn't actually possess. Some claim this information comes from humanity's Collective Unconscious; others point instead to the servants of the Elder Ones and whisper nervously. Regardless of its source, Savant grants the Wyrdling temporary (5 minutes or less) knowledge and mastery of a topic. She might tap into knowledge needed to disarm a bomb or build a canoe. Either way, the knowledge is fleeting and fades entirely from memory by the end of five minutes.</li>
	<li><i>Weakness:</i> Opening oneself to the knowledge of outside forces, whatever those forces might be, is a dangerous prospect. As the fifth minute approaches, other knowledges unconnected to the stated topic leak in. When the fifth minute is reached, the knowledge is drowned out by a sea of unrelated and often nonsensical facts. If this connection isn't broken by the start of the sixth minute the Wyrdling slips unconscious for at least an hour. When she wakes up, expect a hell of a headache...</li>
	<li><i>Appearance:</i> A third eye on the forehead, arcane symbols "tattooed" onto the face, electrical wires for hair, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Shroud of Darkness</h4>

<ul>
	<li><i>Advantage:</i> Allows the Wyrdling to encase themselves in shadow. During the day this makes their features difficult to see and details are obscured (similar to a blurry security camera's video quality). At night, this power allows the Wyrdling to become effectively invisible and they cannot be seen unless a beam of light is shined directly at them.</li>
	<li><i>Weakness:</i> The darkness of the Shroud makes it home in the Wyrdling, which leads to a marked streak of cruelty as their very Soul is infused with Shadow. This won't make a Saint into a mass-murderer, but compassion is notably harder to have. Also, the Shadow interacts strangely with the world and, while the Wyrdling still has a reflection, its semi-opaque and colors are washed out. At a glance, many will assume the Wyrdling has no reflection at all.</li>
	<li><i>Appearance:</i> The Wyrdling's skin grows waxy and pale while stretching to give her face a very gaunt look. Alternatively, the Shadow may infuse her form and make her skin the deep black of the void which means only her eyes and teeth have any color.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Slither</h4>

<ul>
	<li><i>Advantage:</i> The Wyrdling can dislocate and reform her bones at will, allowing her to fit through any hole or gap bigger than an inch. The act of oozing through a gap like that is extremely disconcerting to watch and often causes immense fear or revulsion. Finally, the malleability of bones means damage is cut in half from non-piercing weapons.</li>
	<li><i>Weakness:</i> The malleability of the bones makes strength difficult to build for the Wyrdling, meaning their strength is effectively halved. Also, piercing weapons (spears, swords, bullets, etc) do extra damage as its rubbery body is punctured.</li>
	<li><i>Appearance:</i> Rubbery skin, "indistinct" features and body shape as maintaining a solid form is difficult, or "flat man" appearance.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Tiny</h4>

<i>Note: Cannot be taken with "Immense."</i>

<ul>
	<li><i>Advantage:</i> Smaller size means the Wyrding can fit through small spaces easily, is harder to hit in combat, and increased speed in some situations.</li>
	<li><i>Weakness:</i> Faster heart rate and higher excitability make focusing more difficult and passing out easier. Also, due to reduced size, damage taken is increased.</li>
	<li><i>Appearance:</i> No significant appearance change beyond size. Tiny Wyrdlings are generally 1-3 feet tall (generally closer to 3) and weigh 100 lbs or less. The Wyrdling's Glamour is generally about 4 feet tall.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Unnatural Beauty</h4>

<ul>
	<li><i>Advantage:</i> Wyrdlings with this trait are astoundingly alluring. Any person who sees this Wyrdling's true form is struck silent and frozen in awe for at least one minute. Also, while people are in awe, the Wyrdling can issue a single word command which will be followed for a post (for supernaturals) or two posts (for mortals).</li>
	<li><i>Weakness:</i> Those who see an Unnatural Beauty will easily remember what they've seen. The Mists are still in effect, but no longer fully applies to the Wyrdling's appearance. Mortals will remember the "angel" or "goddess" forever and will often try their hardest to find the Wyrdling again. Individuals want differing things when searching however... Some want to worship the Wyrdling, others want to capture her, while other wish only to kill the "false god/angel."</li>
	<li><i>Appearance:</i> Beauty is a subjective and cultural thing, so the exact appearances of this trait vary wildly amongst individual Wyldlings. Typically however this manifests as unblemished skin, remarkable (sometimes unnaturally colored) eyes, and fine features.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Wings</h4>

<ul>
	<li><i>Advantage:</i> Allows Gliding and Limited flight capabilities (up to 10 mph for 10 mins or less).</li>
	<li><i>Weakness:</i> Hollow/Fragile bones mean that the Wyrdling takes double damage from any blunt weapon (clubs, bats, stones, etc).</li>
	<li><i>Appearance:</i> Bird wings, Bat wings, Insect Wings, Steel Wings, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cosmetic Trait</h4>

<ul>
	<li><i>Advantage:</i> None</li>
	<li><i>Weakness:</i> None</li>
	<li><i>Appearance:</i> This is for purely cosmetic (meaning no advantage/disadvantage) traits which alter Appearance and change how your character looks. This can be "taken" as many times as you wish to create the "look" you want for your Wyrdling's "true" (non-Glamour) form.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Unique Trait</h4>

<i>As every Wyrdling is unique and different from the others, it would be impossible to list every single possible trait. While the above traits are constructed to be generalized and customizable to accommodate most things Wyrdlings are capable of doing. If you wish your Wyrdling to have something which falls outside the above generalizations fill out and PM the following code to a member of Staff.</i>

<ul>
	<li><i>Advantage:</i> </li>
	<li><i>Weakness:</i> </li>
	<li><i>Appearance:</i> </li>
</ul>
