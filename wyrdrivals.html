<h2>The Court of Seasons</h2>
<p> This is the leadership of the local Wyrdlings, rotating with the seasons in a ritualistic handing of power upon the equinox or solstice.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Baronness of Spring:</b> Susan Varjostyn, Skogsra Darkling </li>
	<li><b>Duchess of Summer:</b> Heather Belcourt, Jackrabbit Beast</li>
	<li><b>Baron of Autumn:</b> Adam Linton, Dragon Fairest</li> 
	<li><b>Duke of Winter:</b> Nathan Kilne, Stone Elemental</li>
</ul>
	
<h2>Conspiracies</h2>
<p>
Many folks, especially Magi, are members of one Conspiracy or another because doing so is a sign of status among them. Vampires don't call their groups "Conspiracies" and prefer to call them "Cabals" instead, but the concepts are tremendously similar. Werewolves tend to gather in "Packs" which are also similar, but tend to be much larger and loosely organized. Wyrdlings have dozens of names for such groupings, but they tend to agree that "Conspiracy" works as well as any for such groups. While mixing between the various species are rare, such "cross-species" groups do exist as well.
</p>
<p>
The basic idea behind a Conspiracy is simple: A group of individuals organized towards a common purpose. This can mean as few as two individuals gathering for friendship or as many as thousands organized to manipulate global politics/media. All that identifies a Conspiracy as such is a purpose and more than one member.
</p>
<ul>
	<h3><li><i>"Motley":</i> </h3>
		<p>The smallest and most common type of Conspiracy amongst Wyrdlings is the Motley. A motley, sometimes called a "Madhouse" or other similar terms, is essentially just a group of 2-5 wyrdlings who associate and work together for various tasks. These tasks can be mundane, magical, or both. This is basically a group of friends who also happen know each other's mystic inclinations as well of social preferences.</p></li>
	<h3><li><i>The Minds Eye Theatre:</i> </h3>
		<p>Existing since roughly 1990, the Minds Eye Theatre has become the de facto "home base" of the local Wyrdlings. In the center of the neighborhood nicknamed "Wyrdtown," the Minds Eye Theatre is where the Barons and Duchesses of the Freehold hold their seasonal courts and is universally known to be a safe haven for local Wyrdlings. </p></li>
	<h3><li><i>The Red Hat Society:</i></h3>
		<p>Founded in the 1960s, the Red Hat Society was responding to a need. They saw Wyrdlings, freshly returned, wandering the streets without a Glamour. Even when they could again look human, most Wyrdlings couldn't get jobs and slept in the streets. The Red Hats were a group of Wyrdling women, well placed in society and with money to spare, who set out to fix things. SInce that time, they have constantly struggled to find fresh Wyrdlings and help them re-join society.
</p></li>
	<h3><li><i>The Lawn-Art Irregulars:</i></h3>
		<p>Originally a product of the 90s grunge movement and its connected art community, the Irregulars were formed from a collection of artistically minded Wyrdlings that had grown tired of hiding their nature from mortals. While safety and sanity made overt revelation of the supernatural to humanity, the Irregulars knew that careful exposures to "Wyrdness" would desensitize mortals and open their minds to such creatures. Thus, through their art they seek to "prepare" humanity for the exposure of supernaturals to the wider world. In the meantime, they build their own little communes and artistic communities where they can "live free" and drop their Glamour without fear from the "prepared" mortals that live there.
</p></li>
	<h3><li><i>S.E.L.F.:</i></h3>
		<p> According to SELF, the problem isn't the Exalted Order. It isn't the Kindly Ones. It isn't even the “Mortals.” It's the supernaturals themselves. They think themselves so much better than “mere mortals,” yet they hide themselves away. They tell themselves that the fight against the cold, superiority of the Exalted or the Wyld chaos of the Faerie Lords. Instead, SELF claims, everyone needs to realize that supernaturals have been nothing but a bunch of hypocrites. If “mortals” are truly capable of learning to coexist with supernaturals, as proven by the “locals,” why not now? If they can learn magic like the philosophers say, why wait? We need to stop hiding in the shadows and take things to the streets!</p></li>
